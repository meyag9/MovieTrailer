Movie Trailer Project

#### To run this program:
1. Unzip the movieiTrailer.zip file. 
2. open the file "entertainmentCenter.py" with python IDE
3. Run Module

#### Steps in making this program: 
1. Created a file "media.py" and created a class "Movie" that would initialize movie title, 
summary, poster, and trailer in the init function. 
2. Created another file "entertainmentCenter.py" and imported media. In this file I 
created 6 instances of the movie class and initialized them with specific data. Next I 
created a array of instances so that the information can be displayed on the web page. 
3. Passed my movie array to the "open_movies_page" function in "fresh_tomatoes.py". 
4. Test/run the module from "media.py"
